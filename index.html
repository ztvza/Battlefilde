			As we know, DICE is a studio that developed this line of games. They were created in 1942. And they come from Switzerland. And it was created by four friends - Ulf Mandorf, Olaf Gustavson, Fredrick Liligren and Andreas Axelson. And they were bought by EA in 2006. This studio has a long and interesting story. How 4 friends started proctically from nothing and created a huge company. Now there are several DICE units located around the world, but the most popular unit is located in Los Angeles, and is called DICE LA. This is due to a variety of Easter jokes in the game. It is DACE LA. made a secret white skin in BF4 (Battlefilede 4), for which you need to unravel a special cipher (which each has its own). Bf. in the prince herself.</p>

		<h2>About me.</h2>
		<p> What about me, I started with the game BF4. I played on the PS4 platform. and at first it was insanely difficult for me, but I played with a friend, and so I quickly learned to play it. And at the moment I have level 79. Maximum level 100. I also played BF 1, a pretty good game, I played it less, but according to my feelings it is much easier to play it. Because mechanics are a little easier there. and people there do not play so well. I did not play other projects, but I would like to play Badcompany 2.</p>
